@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use GPIO BSRR (Port bit set/reset register) and 
BRR (Port bit reset register) for IO toggling.
These registers allow modifying only one or several GPIO pins in a single atomic
write access.
GPIO_LED Port Pin 6, Pin 7, Pin 8 and Pin 9 are toggled in an infinite loop.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x High-Density, STM32F10x Medium-Density and
    STM32F10x Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    High-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (STM32F10x Medium-Density) evaluation boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins


  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - system_stm32f10x.c
    
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example

@note
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
